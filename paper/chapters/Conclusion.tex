\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper demonstrates an approach for a continuous painting detection and room prediction algorithm during a museum walk. The first approach was very rudimental and therefor had a lot of weaknesses. Most of these weaknesses were resolved in a second approach which resulted in a bounding box accuracy of 81.31\%. The improved algorithm detected a total of 750 out of 836 paintings correct. On top of that, it also found 32 nonexistent paintings.

It must be noticed that image matching based on two types of histograms results in a high average matching probability of 92.24\% on the dataset. In combination with the detection algorithm, 702 out of 762 detected paintings were correctly matched.

Another conclusion is that when certain parameters of the algorithm were tweaked to improve accuracy, the performance dropped and vice versa. So it's more art than science to find the perfect balance.

The use of a custom Hidden Markov model makes it possible to determine the current room using a stochastic method. This model ignores impossible teleportations through the museum and predicts a viable path, keeping in mind that a certain room could be skipped because of bad matching results due to poor frame quality.

Are you tired of exploring a museum on a map and figuring out where you are?

Have you ever wondered what the final trip, made during an excursion, was?

This paper focusses on describing the different steps to reconstruct the path of an excursion through a museum. The first section describes how the paintings are cut out of high quality pictures. The following section explains an algorithm that can independently find paintings in a picture. This section also describes how accuracy metrics can be collected, which is useful to search for possible improvements. The third section is about how painting are being matched. This means that this section describes performant solutions to figure out which painting is visible in a picture. The fourth section is about how to localize where a person is. This uses an implementation based on the Hidden-Markov model to decide which location is a logical result. The fifth and final section is about the visualization of the result. This section describes a modern way of showing the visited rooms in the museum.
